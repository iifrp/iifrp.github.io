The International Institute of Food Related Protocols (IIFRP) is an community of
people devoted to the idea that the foods we eat deserve special attention. So many
people all over the world struggle to define and often to consistently deliver delicious
foods. Our mission is to enable both consumers and producers of these dishes the
ability to be certain that what they order or serve is what they actually want.
We fight, as a community, to eliminate confusion by standardizing what being a
specific foodstuff actually means.

We fight to make sure that a melt is a melt, and a shake isn't a malt. We fight So
that future generations know on what bread to serve a Ruben. We fight for the food.

Together we can make your next meal perfectly standard.
