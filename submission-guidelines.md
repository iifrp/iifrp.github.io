The standards submission process is open to the public. If you have a good idea for a foodstuff standard, then we're excited to hear it.


#### Standards Submissions

If you'd like to formally submit a document for acceptance as a standard, then please submit it as a request to the mailing list with either the `[Proposed Standard]` or `[Standard Draft]` tags in the subject line.

If your submission is accepted for review by the standards committee it will be added to the site as either a proposed standard or draft submission (according to the subject line tag). The submission will then undergo community discussion as an official RFC before it can be accepted.

Once a draft or proposal is accepted as an official standard, it will be updated accordingly by the staff.


#### Types of Submissions

All accepted documents are given a designation as per the following categories. Users can deduce the designation of a document by checking the top of the page while reading the document. The colored banner will denote the type.

- **Draft [Red]**: Any document that is in the process of being written.
- **Informational [Orange]**: A document that is not considered accepted as standard, but provides additional context about a standards decision or comparisons of different or similar standards.
- **Experimental [Yellow]**: Any document detailing either an experimental recipe or possibly research studies relating.
- **Best Common Practice [Magenta]**: A document detailing a best practice. Normally these are for processes in preparation in general.
- **Proposed Standard [Indigo]**: Documents that are undergoing the acceptance process to become official standards.
- **Internet Standard [Green]**: Accepted community standards. These are the criteria for being an *IIFRP Compliant Product*.
- **Historic [Gray]**: Previously accepted standards, or practices documents which are no longer relevant, but preserved for historical context.
- **Obsolete [Brown]**: Previously accepted standards, or practices documents which are no longer accepted and have been superseded by another standard.
- Unknown or Misc. [White]: Any document that does not fit into these categories or that the committee hasn't assigned a designation.
