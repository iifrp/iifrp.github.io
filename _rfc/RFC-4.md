This document seeks to clarify the scope of RFC #2 [RFC2].

Nothing in RFC #2 should give the impression that all documents submitted for consideration be of the format described in RFC #2.

That particular document only applies to RFCs intending to be submitted as proposed standards. Informational documents, notes, and other submissions are not required to take any format under the standard described in that proposal.

This clarification on an RFC has been submitted by the author.
