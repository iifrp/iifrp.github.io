<span id="1.1">1.1.</span> Rationale and Scope

Without a process for the adoption of proposed standards, the IIFRP would be unable to formally undergo its duties as a standards-making body. This proposal attempts to remedy that situation.

This document does not propose a process for all of the various steps that usually take place before a proposal is made, nor does it detail the process for adopting amendments to accepted standards.


<span id="1.2">1.2.</span> Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "may", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [IETF RFC2119][RFC2119].

   [RFC2119]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119


<span id="2">2.</span> **FORMAL SPECIFICATION**

This section describes a proposed process for the adoption of proposed standards (in the form of requests for comment). It also details the requirements that must be met before the process can take place.

1. The proposal MUST be extant and follow the format described in RFC #2 [RFC2].
2. The proposal MUST be published on the official IIFRP site and categorized as a "Proposed Standard". Drafts are not to be voted on.
3. The proposal MUST be published for a minumum of 30 days before an adoption vote can be called. Any member may request an adoption vote.
4. The proposal MUST remain published and unmodified during the voting period.
5. Once an adoption vote is called, the voting period MUST begin no later than 7-days from the call (baring extreme or unforeseen circumstances).
6. The voting period MUST be at least 30 days long, though additional time may be requested or given. Voting periods can last no longer than 90 days.
7. Once a voting period expires, the votes MUST be tallied as soon as possible.
8. A proposal MUST meet the following criteria to be adopted as an official Adopted Standard:
    - The proposal MUST receive at least one vote.
    - The proposal MUST receive more votes in favor of adoption than against.
9. Once the votes are talled, the results MUST be published on the mailing list.
10. If a proposal is accepted, it MUST be marked as an "Adopted Standard" on the website.
